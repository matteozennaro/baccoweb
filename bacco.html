          <h2>The idea</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          A new generation of <b>galaxy surveys</b> will soon start measuring the spatial distribution of millions of
          galaxies over a broad range of redshifts, offering an imminent opportunity to discover new physics. A detailed
          comparison of these measurements with theoretical models of galaxy clustering may reveal a new fundamental
          particle, a breakdown of General Relativity, or a hint on the nature of cosmic acceleration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite a significant progress in the analytic treatment of structure formation in recent years, traditional
          clustering models still suffer from large uncertainties. This limits cosmological analyses to a very
          restricted range of scales and statistics, which will be one of the main obstacles to reach a comprehensive
          exploitation of future surveys.
          With BACCO we propose to develop a novel simulation-based approach to predict galaxy clustering. Combining
          recent advances in computational cosmology, from cosmological N-body calculations to physically-motivated
          galaxy formation models, we will develop a <b>unified framework</b> to directly predict the positions and
          velocity of individual dark matter structures and galaxies as function of cosmological and astrophysical
          parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this formulation, galaxy clustering will be a prediction of a set of physical assumptions in a given
          cosmological setting. The new theoretical framework will be <b>flexible, accurate and fast</b>: it will
          provide predictions for any clustering statistic, down to scales 100 times smaller than in state-of-the-art
          perturbation--theory--based models, and in less than 1 minute of CPU time. These advances will enable major
          improvements in future cosmological constraints, which will significantly increase the overall power of future
          surveys <b>maximising our potential to discover new physics</b>.

          <h2>Many ingredients...</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
        <p>
          A <b>comprehensive and powerful cosmological calculator</b>: set the parameters of your cosmological model, including
          massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy, and start getting theoretical predictions for many possible
          observables. BACCO's cosmology class features a wrapper to call <a href="https://camb.info/">camb</a> and <a
            href="https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public">class</a>, implementations of methods to compute nonlinear
          quantities with perturbation theory or halofit for correlations functions, power spectra and bispectra, many
          models of mass functions, bias-mass and halo concentration-mass relations. Moreover, it integrates redshift
          space models accounting both for bulk motions and small-scale velocity dispersions.
        </p>
        <h3>Simulations</h3>
        <p>
          A lean version of Gadget, LG3, which allows us to create large simulations while keeping computing tame and RAM
          usage under control. Moreover, by computing many halo properties on the fly and by storing data in HDF5
          format, we make the loading and analysis on simulations a simple and efficient task. See also the <a
            href="data.html">data</a> page!
        </p>
        <h3>Mocks</h3>
        <p>
          How faithfully can we reproduce the properties of galaxies? Thanks to all the properties computed on-the-fly
          by our versiong of LG3, we have access to a wealth of information on the structures and substractures of our
          simulation. This enables us to produce state-of-the-art galaxy samples through subhalo abundance matching
          techinques, with much freedom to vary which physical quantities to match. Moreover, among the outputs of our
          simulations, we also store the entire merging history, making it easy to run semi-analytical models on the
          outputs of our simulations.
        </p>
        <h3>Neutrinos</h3>
        <p>
          Nowadays, a thorough implementation of the effects of massive neutrinos is fundamental in order to achieve the
          precision required by forthcoming cosmological observations. We payed extra-care in <a
            href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.5938Z/abstract">implementing neutrino effects</a> in
          bacco, and we assumed the <a
            href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.428.3375A/abstract">quasi-nonlinear Fourier space
            implementation</a> of neutrinos in LG3.
        </p>
        <h3>Baryons</h3>
        <p>
          We cannot hope to push our predictions to small scales if we do not model the effects of baryons on the
          matter distribution! Bacco features a <a
            href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191108471A/abstract">custom-made revised and efficient
            implementation</a> of the baryon-correction model, in which dark matter particles of each halo are
          rearranged, according to some physically motivated prescriptions, to reproduce the density profile of the
          galaxy, hot gas and expelled gas. Thanks to this method, the dark matter distribution can be let relax and
          adapt to the presence of the baryon components, obtaining results in very good agreement with hydro-dynamical
          simulations.
        </p>
        <h3>Bayesian analysis</h3>
        <p>
          A new method to accurately reconstruct the shape of the multi-dimensional posterior distribution is one of the
          fundamental parts of bacco. This answers the need of modern cosmology for reconstructing the posterior
          distribution of the free parameters of the model while being very efficient in terms of number of likelihood
          evaluations needed. Therefore BACCO includes a <a
            href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191208806P/abstract">likelihood emulator</a> constructed
          with an iterative process, with the possibility of accounting for noise in the adopted theoretical models.
        </p>
        <h3>Visualization</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes abstracting things and considering their statistical properties is just not enough: we are still
          speaking of objects that do exist in the universe around us! For both scientific and dissemination purposes
          it's important to visualize the matter density fields and appreciate their spatial distribution and the
          complexity of the cosmic web!
