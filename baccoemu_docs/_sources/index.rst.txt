The bacco emulator provides predictions for the cold matter power spectrum in
a wide cosmological parameter space, including dynamical dark energy and
massive neutrinos.

More information is available on the
`bacco website <http://dipc.org/bacco.html>`_ and in the `presentation
paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200406245A/abstract>`_.
